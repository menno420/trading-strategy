# setup-universal.sh — universal defensive environment setup for this lane.
#
# Synced 2026-07-09 with the fleet canonical copy:
#   menno420/fleet-manager · environments/templates/setup-universal.sh
#   (blob 6b4459b) — adopted verbatim below the header because it is materially
#   stronger than this lane's first draft: set +e posture, per-repo
#   scripts/env-setup.sh escape hatch, .git-based multi/single-repo detection.
# Owner pastes this into: claude.ai/code → Environments → <env> → Setup script.
#
# CONTRACT (fleet playbook R15; learned here 2026-07-09, two sessions killed):
# this script NEVER fails the session. A failing setup script = dead session,
# no signal — the worker never even reports. Every step below is non-fatal and
# the script ALWAYS exits 0. Worst case is a session with missing deps that
# can still report and self-repair; that beats no session at all.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Block 1: defensive posture --------------------------------------------
# set +e     -> a non-zero step must not abort the script.
# no set -u  -> unset variables are tolerated, never fatal.
# no pipefail-> a hiccup mid-pipe is tolerated, never fatal.
set +e

log() { echo "[env-setup] $*"; }

# --- Block 2: per-repo setup ------------------------------------------------
# Detection order for each repo, most-specific first:
#   1. repo ships scripts/env-setup.sh  -> run it (the repo knows best; this is
#      also the escape hatch for repos pinned to a non-default interpreter).
#   2. repo has requirements.txt        -> pip install it under python3.
#   3. neither                          -> skip silently (docs-only repo is fine).
# Every branch is guarded: one broken repo must never block the others.

# --- Block 3: multi-repo vs single-repo detection ---------------------------
# Multi-repo environment: the working dir is a workspace whose CHILD dirs are
# the git clones (e.g. /home/user/{trading-strategy,substrate-kit}).
# Single-repo environment: the working dir IS the repo (it has .git).

  # Single-repo fallback: set up the repo we are standing in.

  # checkout without .git (or an unexpected layout) gets a best-effort pass.

# The single most important line in the file (R15). Do not "improve" this.
