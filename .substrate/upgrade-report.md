+**Preflight first — land on origin's HEAD before reading anything else:**
+
+```
+git fetch origin main && git reset --hard origin/main
+```
+
+(or `git checkout -B main origin/main`; substitute your default branch).
+Then verify: local HEAD (`git rev-parse HEAD`) must equal
+`git ls-remote origin main`. A warm container clone can lag origin by
+dozens of commits, and a stale clone reads stale orders and stale state —
+every orientation read below assumes this step already ran. The hard reset
+discards uncommitted local changes by design: at session START there should
+be none; if `git status` shows work you did not author, stop and report it
+instead of resetting over it.
 
 The boot set lives in the working agreement — `CONSTITUTION.md` — and its
